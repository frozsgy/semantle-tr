# Semantle TÃ¼rkÃ§e 

This repository contains the Turkish version of [Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org/).

## Initial Setup

- Create a virtual environment and install required Python modules from `requirements.txt`. 
- Use the `word2vec/train.sh` file to train a Turkish Word2Vec model using the Wikipedia corpus.
- Run `python dump-vecs.py` to initialize the SQLite database with vectors.
- Run `python dump-hints.py` to create hints pickle.
- Run `python store-hints.py` to import the hints pickle to the database.

## Deployment & Running the App

- Run `docker-compose up -d`. The project should be up and running at HTTP port 80.

## Notes

This project was forked from the original [Semantle](https://gitlab.com/novalis_dt/semantle) repository and some modifications to the `dump-hints.py` file were cherry picked from the [Semantle-es](https://github.com/A12Studios/semantle-es) repository.

## Known Bugs

- Since Turkish is an agglutinative language, while looking for similar words you will see lots of words with suffixes. I'm planning to clean up the corpus to work with lemmas or stems and improve the performance.
